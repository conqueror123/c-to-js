ever wondere if you could convert a c program to javascript and run it as html well i have done that

Well this is just a hello world program it converts from c to html
working its business logic through the javascript
i have wrote a shellscript for this process once u run the shellscript rest of all is taken care of

clone the repo
extract the repo
write a hello world program in c
copy paste the program to the directory
and run the shell script by ./run

note:u must have firefox browser for this and linux machine
because I used shellscript

guys work on this 
this is only the hello world still a lot need to be done

damn programming feels good especially if u write something on you own
